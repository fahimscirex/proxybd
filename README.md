## What's this?
This repo contains lists of Bangladeshi proxy servers. Proxies are scraped automatically from known sources. Every proxy has IPv4 entry-node and exit-node. 
Currently available source is limited, that's why the number of proxy isn't that much. It would be much help if you provied some sources. 

## Folder Description
- `proxylist` > contains proxies with any level of anonymity.
- `anonymous-proxylist` > contains anonymous proxies only.
